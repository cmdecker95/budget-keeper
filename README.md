Script to add purchases or other transactions to a budget file. Launched via Apple Shortcuts, which runs a webhook to run the script in Pythonista, given arguments passed to the Shortcut. The webhook runs the script from its synced location in iCloud, thanks to Working Copyâ€™s repo sync feature. Budget scripts are thus able to be privatized within iCloud while the script can remain publicized and version controlled.

## How it works right now
- Through an **iOS Shortcut**, the user selects a budgeting function (like adding an expense or logging a deposit) and enters all relevant values.
- User input from the iOS Shortcut is converted into a webhook that launches this code in the **Pythonista** app (iOS).
- Along with launching the code, the **webhook** also passes the relevant values as `[sys.argv]` for use within the code.
- Arguments are handled according to the user-selected function, each of which **reads and modifies the most recent budget file** in `/budgets`.
- Finally, the modified budget file is **summarized in the Python console**.

## What I want to change
Writing budgets to text files was the original way I handled my budgets, but they are now an unnecessary middleman. I want to refactor this project to utilize secure databasing (like MongoDB or Firebase), which will improve this repo in two main ways:
- I can publicize the code while still privatizing the sensitive budget information.
- The code will not have to turn a text file into a JSON-like object *just to turn it back into text after use*.
