Script to add purchases or other transactions to a budget file. Launched via Apple Shortcuts, which runs a webhook to run the script in Pythonista, given arguments passed to the Shortcut. The webhook runs the script from its synced location in iCloud, thanks to Working Copyâ€™s repo sync feature. Budget scripts are thus able to be privatized within iCloud while the script can remain publicized and version controlled.
